# foreman-content-pack
This content pack provides you with:
- Foreman: Host actions stream
- Foreman: Host create actions
- Foreman: Host delete actions
- Foreman: Host modify actions

[Foreman](http://www.theforeman.org) is a complete lifecycle management tool for physical and virtual servers and provides a plugin named foreman_hooks with which you can trigger events when creating, updating and deleting hosts.

The Foreman hook script specified below provides the possibility to log the Foreman host actions to Graylog2, it can be [downloaded](https://github.com/dschutterop/graylog2/tree/master/Foreman_hooks) as well.

If you place the script in the Foreman hooks directory (as described in the script itself) your Foreman host orchestration events will be logged to Graylog2.
